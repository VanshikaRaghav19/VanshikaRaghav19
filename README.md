## 🛠️ What I Do
**Make 3D characters** look cooler than me IRL... 🤕
**Game-ready animations** (because why not add drama to every click!!)
**UI/UX design** that won’t hurt your eyes (I promise 🤞)...
**Code experiments** that sometimes... explode
**Bug whisperer** Level: 99 😁😋

Bringing characters to life without accidentally summoning Skynet...
Creating animations that do more than T-pose...
